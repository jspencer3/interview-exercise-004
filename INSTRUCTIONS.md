# INSTRUCTIONS

This is a little exercise to help you get a feel for what would be asked of you and to give us an idea of where you are at comfort level wise.  Some of the steps below will be very basic and it should theoretically ramp to more challenging tasks.  The intent is not necessarily to finish this, an hour or so at most should be spent on it.  You are welcome to choose the language of your choice for the steps below.  Python or Golang would be uiltized in day to day but that is just FYI, you are welcome to choose whatever you are most comfortable with.  Also, just as it would be in a normal day to day feel free to use the internet as you need, this is not supposed to be something you are just doing from memory.

# STEPS

## SETUP
1. Clone this repo to your local environment.
2. Create a work branch for yourself.
3. Create a new file called NOTES.md to write down anything you learn, have questions about, or think is worth otherwise noting as you go along!
4. Commit your file to your local branch and push it to the origin repository.

## FIRST RUN
1. Create whatever file structure you need for your language of choice to be able to run a simple command line app
2. Update the command line app to print the basic "Hello world!" to stdout.
3. Commit your changes to your local branch and push them to the origin repository.

## OK, SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING!
1. Create the application structure you will need to model a standard deck of playing cards.  4 suits, 13 ranks.  
2. Update your command line app to print the deck to stdout.
3. Write a method/function that will shuffle the deck as needed and again print it to stdout.  

## SOMETHING SLIGHTLY MORE USEFUL!
1. Update your app to simulate a shuffling and then dealing a 5 card poker hand.
2. Write a method/function that evaluates the hand and prints its result (2 pair, straight, etc.).
4. Extra credit: compute the probability of receiving that ranking of poker hand.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch and push them to the origin repository.

Don't forget to write a couple quick notes about the exercise in NOTES.md!  Were parts too hard, to easy, were there parts you knew once but had forgotten, did you learn something new, etc.?  Good luck!
